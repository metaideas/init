# `mobile`

NOTE: This package currently doesn't run, since Bun hoists the latest `tailwindcss` to the root level, and `nativewind` doesn't support it.

If you need to run this together with the other apps, you can do the following:

- Degrade the `tailwindcss` version to `3.4.17` in other apps, and adjust accordingly.
- Use a different package manager, like `pnpm`.
- Wait for `nativewind` to support `tailwindcss` v4.
    - See: https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/discussions/1422
- Wait for Bun to support `nohoist` to allow multiple versions of the same package to be installed.
    - See: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6850
- Use another styling solution for the mobile app.

Hopefully we can find a fix for this soon.
