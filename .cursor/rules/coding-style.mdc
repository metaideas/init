# Coding Style and Conventions

## Key Principles

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Use descriptive function names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., getUserSettings, setUserSettings, checkIsMobile)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow the project structure detailed in [README.md](mdc:README.md).

## Imports

- For packages inside `apps`, use the `~/` alias for imports coming from `[app] /src`.
- For packages inside `packages`, use relative imports.
- Use the `@this/` alias for importing packages in the monorepo.
- Never allow imports between `apps`, except from [client.ts](mdc:apps/api/src/client.ts), which should only be used as a development dependency.
- Avoid circular imports.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes (kebab-case) for directories and files (e.g. components/auth-wizard).
- Favor default exports for components, unless exporting multiple functions from the file.

## Typescript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use readonly arrays or maps with `as const`.
- Use functional components with props and children, and destructure the props.


## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Use the `function` keyword for components.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX.

## UI and Styling

- Use components inside `@this/ui` or `@this/native-ui` to create components.
- Use the `cn` function inside `@this/utils/classname` for classname composition.
