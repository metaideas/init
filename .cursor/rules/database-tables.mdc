# Database Tables

## Key Principles

- Follow the coding styles used inside [auth.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/auth.ts) and [organizations.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/organizations.ts).
- We use Drizzle as our ORM. Follow Drizzle's best practices.
- We must always add relations to [relations.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/relations.ts). Follow the patterns already described in that file.
- Use timestamps inside [helpers.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/helpers.ts) where it makes sense. For example, it makes sense to have both in the user but not in an activity log record that is never updated.
- Tables related to our core logic go inside [core.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/core.ts)

## Generating IDs

- We use prefixed IDs for our entities. See [helpers.ts](mdc:packages/db/src/schema/helpers.ts) for our `constructId` function.
- The prefix should be 3 letters. Make sure there are no conflicts with existing tables.
