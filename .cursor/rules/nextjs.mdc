- Prioritize using server components (RSC) for performance, SEO, and data fetching.
- Use server actions for data mutations.
- Use client components sparingly, only when interactivity is required. 
- Never make a `page.tsx` have a client directive ("use client"). Create a component inside `features` instead.
- Take advantage of Next.js file-based routing system for simplicity.
- Centralize shared layouts in `layout.tsx` for consistency across pages.
- Add `loading.tsx` to handle loading states for better UX. For nested content that needs to be fetched, use `Suspense` boundaries.
- Implement custom error pages with `error.tsx` to handle errors gracefully.
- Use API route handlers to manage backend logic within the app structure.
- Optimize server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for faster loading times.
- Use `nuqs` package for URL search parameter state management.
