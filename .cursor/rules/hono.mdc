- Use middleware for authentication and logging
- Implement route handlers using `app.get`, `app.post`, etc.
- Structure routes modularly for maintainability
- Handle errors globally with `app.onError`
- Use `c.text()`, `c.json()`, and `c.redirect()` for response handling
- Leverage caching with `Cache-Control` or KV storage
