- For all scripts, use the tooling inside [index.ts](mdc:tooling/helpers/index.ts).
- All Node.js packages should be imported using the `node:` prefix.
- Project wide scripts go inside the root `scripts` folder, and should have a command added in `package.json`. Follow existing conventions in naming the command.
- Workspace specific scripts should go inside their respective `scripts` directory.
- For scripts, use the `runScript` function inside [index.ts](mdc:tooling/helpers/index.ts).
- Use the `@clack/prompts` package for logging and managing CLI input.
- Do not use the `intro` and `outro` from `@clack/prompts`, since the `runScript` already contains them.
- For long running processes, use a `spinner`.
