- We are using Bun for testing. Follow Bun testing best practices.
- Add your tests to the `__tests__` folder, which should be in the same directory as the file you are testing.
- Import the necessary testing dependencies from "bun:test".
- Use the `test`, `describe`, and `expect` functions for writing tests.
- The `describe` should be named after the function you are testing.
- The `test` should be named after the case you are testing.
